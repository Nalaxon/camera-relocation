abstract     = {<p>We address the problem of inferring the pose of an RGB-D camera relative to a
                known 3D scene, given only a single acquired image. Our approach employs a
                regression forest that is capable of inferring an estimate of each pixel’s
                correspondence to 3D points in the scene’s world coordinate frame. The forest
                uses only simple depth and RGB pixel comparison features, and does not require
                the computation of feature descriptors. The forest is trained to be capable of
                predicting correspondences at any pixel, so no interest point detectors are
                required. The camera pose is inferred using a robust optimization scheme. This
                starts with an initial set of hypothesized camera poses, constructed by applying
                the forest at a small fraction of image pixels. Preemptive RANSAC then iterates
                sampling more pixels at which to evaluate the forest, counting inliers, and
                refining the hypothesized poses. We evaluate on several varied scenes captured
                with an RGB-D camera and observe that the proposed technique achieves highly
                accurate relocalization and substantially out-performs two state of the art
                baselines.</p>},

abstract     = {<p>KinectFusion enables a user holding and moving a standard Kinect camera to
                rapidly create detailed 3D reconstructions of an indoor scene. Only the depth
                data from Kinect is used to track the 3D pose of the sensor and reconstruct,
                geometrically precise, 3D models of the physical scene in real-time. The
                capabilities of KinectFusion, as well as the novel GPU-based pipeline are
                described in full. We show uses of the core system for low-cost handheld
                scanning, and geometry-aware augmented reality and physics-based interactions.
                Novel extensions to the core GPU pipeline demonstrate object segmentation and
                user interaction directly in front of the sensor, without degrading camera
                tracking or reconstruction. These extensions are used to enable real-time
                multi-touch interactions anywhere, allowing any planar or non-planar
                reconstructed physical surface to be appropriated for touch.</p>},

@Inproceedings {newcombe_fusion,
abstract     = {<p>We present a system for accurate real-time mapping of complex and arbitrary
                indoor scenes in variable lighting conditions, using only a moving low-cost depth
                camera and commodity graphics hardware. We fuse all of the depth data streamed
                from a Kinect sensor into a single global implicit surface model of the observed
                scene in real-time. The current sensor pose is simultaneously obtained by
                tracking the live depth frame relative to the global model using a coarse-to-fine
                iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm, which uses all of the observed depth
                data available. We demonstrate the advantages of tracking against the growing
                full surface model compared with frame-to-frame tracking, obtaining tracking and
                mapping results in constant time within room sized scenes with limited drift

                and high accuracy. We also show both qualitative and quantitative results
                relating to various aspects of our tracking and mapping system. Modelling of
                natural scenes, in real-time with only commodity sensor and GPU hardware,
                promises an exciting step forward

                in augmented reality (AR), in particular, it allows dense surfaces to be
                reconstructed in real-time, with a level of detail and robustness beyond any
                solution yet presented using passive computer vision.</p>},
