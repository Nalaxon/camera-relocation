\section{Project Proposal}

\subsection{Introduction} % (fold)
\label{sub:intro}
First, a regression forest based on the Piotr Dollar toolbox \cite{piotr} will be implemented. The Matlab code for the Piotr Dollar toolbox is readily available and we will adapt the random classification forest to create a regression forest. Therefore the split function and output has to be modified.

Secondly the implementation itself should be evaluated, to make a statement to the general performance of the implementation.

After that the implementation should be adapted for camera relocalization as shown by Shotton et al \cite{shotton}. The adapted implementation is further evaluated using the dataset given by Shotton et al.

\subsubsection{Regression Random Forest}
\label{rrf_intro}
The weak learner given by equation (\ref{eqn:weaklearner}) also called split function splits the data into a left and right dataset, by thresholding.

\begin{eqnarray}\label{eqn:weaklearner}
  h(\mathbf{p};\mathbf{\theta}_n) = [ f_{\phi_n}(\mathbf{p}) \geq \tau_n ]
\end{eqnarray}

Such a threshold can be optimized by minimization of the objective function

\begin{eqnarray} \label{eqn:objectiv_function}
  Q(S_n,\theta) = V(S_n) - \sum_{d\in\{L,R\}}{\frac{|S_n^d(\theta)|}{|S_n|}V(S_n^d(\theta))}
\end{eqnarray}

\begin{eqnarray}
  V(S) = \frac{1}{|S|} \sum_{(\mathbf{p},\mathbf{m}) \in S}{||\mathbf{m} - \mathbf{\bar m}||_2^2}
\end{eqnarray}

By computing the mean and variance at each leaf, the probability of the output value is given as well as the output value itself is given simply by the mean value.
Because several trees are included in a forest the output of all trees have to be averaged.

\subsection{Implementation} % (fold)
\label{sub:implementation}
To achieve the defined goal, the Piotr Dollar toolbox \cite{piotr} was adopted. To be more precise the Objective function as given in equation (\ref{eqn:objectiv_function}) was added. Also variance and mean were added as component of the forest structure, while the mean value can be interpreted as the regression result of each tree.

\subsubsection{Evaluation} % (fold)
\label{ssub:camera_relocalization}
First the implementation of a general Random Regression Forest was evaluated. To keep things simple, simple 2D functions were used to calculate an error as well as a visualization.
Some attributes were kept constant:
\begin{itemize}
	\item maxDepth = 50
  \item minChild = 1
\end{itemize}

For the general regression task, the number of input and the amount of trees per forest were varied. The implementation was tested with a one dimensional dataset: $cos(x*pi*4 + (x+1))^2$ which is shown in table ~\ref{tab:res_gen_cos}, and with a two dimensional dataset: $2*x + 3*y$ which is shown in table ~\ref{tab:res_gen_plane}

\begin{landscape}

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}

\subsubsection*{Camera relocalization} % (fold)
\label{ssub:relocalization}
After the general random regression forest, the implementation was extended to perform an camera relocalization task, as shown by Shotton et al. \cite{shotton}. Here the results are presented in table ~\ref{tab:res_reallocation} in order the coordinates in real world coordinates.

\begin{table}[p]
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}

\midrule
\hline

150 & -145.3 & 709.7 & 843.3 & 301.8 & 407.6 & 499.6 & 2.6319e+11  \\ \hline
150 & 429.4 & 472.3 & 49.0 & 297.0 & 394.9 & 498.4 & 5.1679e+10  \\ \hline
50 & -6.4 & 424.0 & 1401.8 & 242.6 & 371.2 & 517.4 & 5.5096e+11  \\ \hline
50 & -48.2 & 503.6 & 1241.9 & 362.0 &  220.7 & 501.4 & 4.2114e+11 \\ \hline
50 & -107.1 & 634.0 & 1054.0 & 308.4 & 408.9 & 503.8 & 3.5035e+11 \\ \hline
50 & 360.2 & 28.7 & 137.9 &  274.8 & 384.9 & 537.4 & 1.5420e+10 \\ \hline
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{The Table shows 5 randomly chosen results of two different trees. Here the data size is fixed to the image size 640x480. RRS being the residual sum of squares. Note that the coordinates are given in real world coordinates.}
\label{tab:res_reallocation}
\end{table}

\subsection{Problems}

Because the relocalization forest should dice at each node the parameters new, it was not possible to calculate the input data in advance. Therefore the decision was made to use a matrix of function handles to perform the calculation of the input data in each node. This has to be done at the training and by applying the forest to actual calculate the result. Because of this the implemenation is much slower than the original classification regression forest. To improve performance at the apply state, it might be possible to calculate the input data only for those pixels which are actual used instead of every pixel. Because in a leaf or deeper nodes, 307200 data points or pixels are calculated but maybe only 4 are used!

Additionally only one image (color as well as its corresponding depth) is used for training and applying instead of the whole image base. This leads also to the bad performance in terms of a big error.
